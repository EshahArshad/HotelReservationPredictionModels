This study looks at using data analysis to predict customer actions and chances of them canceling hotel bookings.
It uses hotel booking data from 'INN Hotels.' 
The work involves cleaning the data, doing a detailed analysis (EDA), and using two methods called K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Decision Tree to make predictions. 
The study deals with fixing data issues like errors, missing information, and uneven data, using a technique called SMOTE. 
The results show that these methods are good at guessing booking cancellations, showing how useful data analysis can be for managing hotels. 
The report carries 15 questions from our study to ensure better understanding of the dataset at hand.
Predictive analytics is very important for hotels because it helps them understand customers behavior. 
By looking at past information, hotels can guess if people will cancel their bookings, what they might want, and when they are likely to visit. 
This helps hotels plan better, offer services that customers like, and set prices that attract more guests. 
It also helps hotels fix problems before they get big.
When hotels know what their customers want ahead of time, they can make their stay better, keep them happy, and encourage them to come back.
